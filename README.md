# `tomltable`: generate LaTeX tables from TOML specifications and JSON data

This Python package provides a command-line utility called `tomltable`.
This utility generates a LaTeX table from a TOML formatted table specification (read from stdin) and a set of JSON files (specified as arguments).

The spiritual ancestor of this package is [`coeftable`](https://github.com/gn0/coeftable) which performed a similar task but without the TOML-based specification language.
